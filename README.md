# NEURO-AXIOM | Project Initialization

**Author:** Jan Zdráhal  
**Identifier:** NEURO-AXIOM  
**Framework:** MatrixCore  
**Type:** Deterministic Systems Architecture  

## Overview
A research framework focused on integrating deterministic architectures to achieve Cognitive Certainty within high-integrity systems.

## Project Fixation & Verification

* **Historical Provenance:** All foundational principles and architectural iterations are documented via official environment exports.

* **Continuous TSA Anchoring:** Integrity is secured through **multiple TSA (Time Stamping Authority) certificates** issued throughout the development process (up to and including February 2026).

* **Development History:** A comprehensive, immutable chronological record exists for all architectural milestones and core deterministic logic.
